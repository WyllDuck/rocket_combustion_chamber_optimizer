# rocket_combustion_chamber_optimizer

Calculation of the dimensions of the regenerative cooled combustion chanmber of a rocket engine
Assumptions:
- Methane coolant at supercritical pressure (change of phase does not requiere an extra heat transfer)
- Cooled from the throat of the engine to the injection plate
